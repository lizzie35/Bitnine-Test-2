# Fibonacci Sequence Calculation - README

This program calculates the Fibonacci sequence using three different approaches: recursion, dynamic programming (bottom-up approach), and memoization (top-down approach). It is implemented in C.

## Development Environment

- Programming Language: C
- Compiler: GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
- Operating System: [Specify the OS on which the code was developed and tested]

## Prerequisites

To compile and run the source code, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- GCC compiler (or any C compiler that supports C99 standard)
- Standard C library (libc)

## Compiling the Source Code

Follow these steps to compile the source code for each approach:

### Recursion

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where the source code file (fibonacci_recursive.c) is located.
3. Run the following command to compile the code:

   ```shell
   gcc -o fibonacci_recursive fibonacci_recursive.c

### Dynamic Programming (Bottom-up approach)

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where the source code file (fibonacci_dynamic.c) is located.
3. Run the following command to compile the code:

shell
gcc -o fibonacci_dynamic fibonacci_dynamic.c

This command uses GCC to compile the source code and generates an executable file named fibonacci_dynamic.

### Memoization (Top-down approach)
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where the source code file (fibonacci_memoize.c) is located.
3. Run the following command to compile the code:

shell
gcc -o fibonacci_memoize fibonacci_memoize.c

This command uses GCC to compile the source code and generates an executable file named fibonacci_memoize.

### Running the Program
Once you have compiled the source code for each approach, you can run the programs by following these steps:

1. In the same terminal or command prompt, execute the following command for each approach:

shell
./fibonacci_recursive

shell
./fibonacci_dynamic

shell
./fibonacci_memoize

These commands run the respective compiled programs.

2. The program will prompt you to enter the value of n for which you want to calculate the Fibonacci sequence.

3. The program will output the result of the Fibonacci calculation.
